My name's Amal and I'm currently working as a ML scientist at J. P. Morgan in London. My work currently involves working with LLMs, thinking about efficient ways to fine-tune them and detect hallucinations in specific scenarios. I have a broad range of interests in the ML space including Bayesian inference, timeseries and generative modelling.
