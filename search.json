Doing this well is something discussed often when people try and come up with principled ways to build models.\nInstead I’ll focus on deep learning and the kinds of models that have helped hype up generative AI. Just remember that with a generative model we want to be able to generate data that looks similar to our training data. That can be unconditional (just generating random faces) or conditioned on other data (think LLMs).\n\n\n\nModel building"
